# Stripe Payment Integration

This Flutter food ordering app now includes Stripe payment integration alongside the existing cash on delivery option.

## Features Added

### 1. Stripe Payment Service (`lib/services/stripe_payment_service.dart`)
- Mock implementation for demo purposes
- Card validation using Luhn algorithm
- Card number formatting
- Expiry date formatting
- Card type detection (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, etc.)

### 2. Stripe Payment Form (`lib/widgets/stripe_payment_form.dart`)
- Beautiful, user-friendly card input form
- Real-time card validation
- Card type detection with visual indicators
- Form validation for all fields
- Secure input formatting

### 3. Updated Checkout Screen
- Two payment options: Cash on Delivery and Credit/Debit Card
- Dynamic UI that shows Stripe form when card payment is selected
- Seamless integration with existing order flow

### 4. Enhanced BLoC State Management
- New `ProcessStripePayment` event
- New `paymentSuccessful` status
- Payment method ID tracking
- Updated order placement flow

## How It Works

### Payment Flow
1. User selects "Credit/Debit Card" payment method
2. Stripe payment form appears with card input fields
3. User enters card details (number, expiry, CVC, name, email)
4. Form validates card information in real-time
5. On submit, payment is processed through Stripe service
6. Upon successful payment, order is automatically placed
7. User is redirected to order confirmation screen

### Demo Implementation
The current implementation uses mock Stripe objects for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, you would:

1. Replace mock classes with actual Stripe API calls
2. Set up a backend server to handle payment intents
3. Use real Stripe publishable and secret keys
4. Implement proper error handling and security measures

## Configuration for Production

### 1. Stripe Keys
Update the keys in `lib/services/stripe_payment_service.dart`:
```dart
static const String _publishableKey = 'pk_live_your_actual_publishable_key';
static const String _secretKey = 'sk_live_your_actual_secret_key';
```

### 2. Backend Integration
Replace the mock implementation with actual Stripe API calls:
- Create payment intents on your backend
- Handle webhook events
- Implement proper error handling
- Add logging and monitoring

### 3. Security Considerations
- Never store secret keys in the mobile app
- Use HTTPS for all API calls
- Implement proper input validation
- Add fraud detection measures

## Testing

### Test Card Numbers
For testing with Stripe's test environment, use these card numbers:
- **Visa**: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- **Mastercard**: 5555 5555 5555 4444
- **American Express**: 3782 822463 10005

### Test CVC and Expiry
- Use any 3-digit CVC for Visa/Mastercard
- Use any 4-digit CVC for American Express
- Use any future expiry date (MM/YY format)

## Dependencies Added

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_stripe: ^10.1.1
  http: ^1.1.0
```
